# Analysis and plotting of COVID-19 data

Here you can access the *processed_data* obtain after running *COVID-19_Ar_ProcessingData.py*. It is saved in
separated *csv* files. Note that some of them have a lot of holes (empty cells) because of the original
data in *Argentina.csv* is incomplete. Data was updated until September 21st. If you want to check more actual
data of the situation in Argentina go to [Mauro Infantino's site](https://covidstats.com.ar).
