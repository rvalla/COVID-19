# Analysis and plotting of COVID-19 data

The data informed in [National Reports](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/coronavirus/informe-diario) published
in Argentina by the Ministry of Health are sometimes outdated. [Mauro Infantino](https://twitter.com/plenque/)
did an incredible work in his site [covidstats.com.ar](https://covidstats.com.ar/) to address this issue
reordering the dataset by *real dates*.  
Here I save some *.csv* files which were generated in his site with the intention to analyze how my
*real estimation* and *known cases ratio* change when I use the reordered data.
