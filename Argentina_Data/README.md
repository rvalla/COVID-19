# Analysis and plotting of COVID-19 data

Here is the data from the [National Reports](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/coronavirus/informe-diario) published
in Argentina by the Ministry of Health. Is saved on a spreadsheet and then exported to a csv file.  
Note that the data is incomplete because these reports has some limitations:
- Data for confirmed cases are informed by district (same case for deaths)
- Data for recovered cases, laboratory tests and dropped cases are informed for all country.
At september 21st authorities change again the reports format, since then I don't update
all data frequently. If you want to learn about *COVID-19* in Argentina you can visit the
site by [Mauro Infantino](https://twitter.com/plenque/): [covidstats.com.ar](https://covidstats.com.ar/).
